# Airtable-Scraper


                          Scraping a (specific) website containing an airtable to filter for student jobs.

The website: https://airtable.com/shrl5EIxGUExC3umi/tblvOwxPcPVcFmwxt
The Scraper: Python's "Beautiful Soup" v4: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/

IDEA:
The idea is to learn how to navigate a scraper through a webite. Still learning what that entails.

STEPS:
If I understand correctly how a websites and scrapers work these are the steps for executing this project's mission:
  1. Find the data part in the website, specifically the addresses of the companies.
  2. Visit each web address and look for these keywords: "Student", "Part-Time" and "Intern"
  
  
Comments:
  1. Regarding the first step, for now I try to keep it simple by only getting the addresses, and not by clicking the job, since mouse      clicking add another element (but will be done in the future). The addresses are specific for a job opening anyway.
